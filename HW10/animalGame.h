//Preconditions: Option 3 called from menu
//Postconditions: displays info about the animal game
void instructions();
//Preconditions: a pointer referencing a location in a binary tree
//Postconditions: asks a quesion in that node of the binary tree, and moves the pointer accordingly
void askAndMove(Binary_Tree_Node<string>*& currPtr);
//Preconditions: a pointer of type string belonging to te binarytreenode class and a file
//Postconditions: creates the binary taxonomy tree from the contents of the file, and returns a pointer to that trees root
Binary_Tree_Node<string>* beginTree(Binary_Tree_Node<string>*& currPtr, ifstream& file);
//Preconditions: a pointer which points to the location in which a new question will be inserted
//Postconditions: creates a question and adds an animal out of user input
void learnNewAnimal(Binary_Tree_Node<string>*& currPtr);
//Preconditions: play game was chose in the menu, a pointer pointing to nullptr or an empty node
//Postconditions: runs the game, asking the user to find the animal the user is thinking of, until if finds the answer or learns a new animal
void runGame(Binary_Tree_Node<string>* currPtr);
//Preconditions: a file and a rootpnr
//Postconditions: creates the binary taxonomy tree by calling begin tree and passes it to runGame

//Preconditions: a taxonmy tree root pointer and a outfile
//Postconditions: saves the taxonomy tree to the file.
